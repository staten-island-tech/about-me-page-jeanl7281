    <h2>Jean Lei</h2>
    <article> Hello, my name is Jean. I'm currently a sophomore and I study at Staten Island Tech. My birthday is on March 8th. I have 4 younger siblings; Michelle(13), Joyce(10), Mathias(8), and Janice(7). I like to text or hangout with my friends in my freetime or clean and organize the house. I joined SYEP in 2021 and 2022 and did PBL(Project Based Learning). At the end of SYEP in 2021, we created a website about Environmental Justice. If you want to check it out, here's the link to it:
